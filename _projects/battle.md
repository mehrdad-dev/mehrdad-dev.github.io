We have undertaken an extensive benchmark evaluation of LLMs and conversational bots. Our evaluation involved the collection of 1002 questions encompassing 27 categories, which we refer to as the “Wordsmiths dataset.” These categories include reasoning, logic, facts, coding, bias, language, humor, and more. Each question in the dataset is accompanied by an accurate and verified answer. We meticulously assessed four leading chatbots: ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, and Claude, using this dataset.
