We proposed the first publicly available datasets in the field of Persian font recognition and employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to address the Persian font recognition problem. The results show that the proposed pipeline obtained 78.0% top-1 accuracy on our new datasets, 89.1% in the IDPL-PFOD dataset, and 94.5% in the KAFD dataset.
