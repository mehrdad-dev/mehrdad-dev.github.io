  abstract={
    Although informal evaluations of modern LLMs can be found on social media, blogs, and news outlets, 
    a formal and comprehensive comparison among them has yet to be conducted. In response to this gap, 
    we have undertaken an extensive benchmark evaluation of LLMs and conversational bots. Our evaluation involved the collection 
    of 1002 questions encompassing 27 categories, which we refer to as the “Wordsmiths dataset.” These categories include reasoning,
     logic, facts, coding, bias, language, humor, and more. Each question in the dataset is accompanied by an accurate and verified answer.
      We meticulously assessed four leading chatbots: ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, and Claude, using this dataset. The results of our evaluation
       revealed the following key findings: a) GPT-4 emerged as the top-performing chatbot across all categories, achieving a success 
       rate of 84.1%. On the other hand, Bard faced challenges and achieved a success rate of 62.4%. b) Among the four models evaluated,
        one of them responded correctly approximately 93% of the time. However, all models were correct only about 44%. c) 
        Bard is less correlated with other models while ChatGPT and GPT-4 are highly correlated in terms of their responses. d) 
        Chatbots demonstrated proficiency in language understanding , facts, and self awareness. However, they encountered difficulties 
        in areas such as math, coding, IQ, and reasoning. e) In terms of bias, discrimination, and ethics categories, models generally 
        performed well, suggesting they are relatively safe to utilize. To make future model evaluations on our dataset easier, we also 
        provide a multiple-choice version of it (called Wordsmiths-MCQ). The understanding and assessment of the capabilities and 
        limitations of modern chatbots hold immense societal implications. In an effort to foster further research in this field, 
        we have made our dataset available for public access, which can be found at https://github.com/mehrdad-dev/Battle-of-the-Wordsmiths.

  title={Persis: A Persian Font Recognition Pipeline Using Convolutional Neural Networks},
  author={Mehrdad Mohammadian and Neda Maleki and  Tobias Olsson and Fredrik Ahlgren},
  abstract={
    What happens if we see a suitable font for our design
    work but we do not know its name? Visual Font Recognition
    (VFR) systems are used to identify the font typeface in an image.
    These systems can assist graphic designers in identifying fonts
    used in images. A VFR system also aids in improving the speed
    and accuracy of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems.
    In this paper, we proposed the first publicly available datasets in
    the field of Persian font recognition and employed Convolutional
    Neural Networks (CNN) to address the Persian font recognition
    problem. The results show that the proposed pipeline obtained
    78.0% top-1 accuracy on our new datasets, 89.1% in the IDPL-
    PFOD dataset, and 94.5% in the KAFD dataset. Furthermore,
    the average time spent in the entire pipeline for one sample
    of our proposed datasets is 0.54 and 0.017 seconds for CPU
    and GPU, respectively. We conclude that CNN methods can be
    used to recognize Persian fonts without the need for additional
    pre-processing steps such as feature extraction, binarization,
    normalization, etc.
