  abstract={
    What happens if we see a suitable font for our design
    work but we do not know its name? Visual Font Recognition
    (VFR) systems are used to identify the font typeface in an image.
    These systems can assist graphic designers in identifying fonts
    used in images. A VFR system also aids in improving the speed
    and accuracy of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems.
    In this paper, we proposed the first publicly available datasets in
    the field of Persian font recognition and employed Convolutional
    Neural Networks (CNN) to address the Persian font recognition
    problem. The results show that the proposed pipeline obtained
    78.0% top-1 accuracy on our new datasets, 89.1% in the IDPL-
    PFOD dataset, and 94.5% in the KAFD dataset. Furthermore,
    the average time spent in the entire pipeline for one sample
    of our proposed datasets is 0.54 and 0.017 seconds for CPU
    and GPU, respectively. We conclude that CNN methods can be
    used to recognize Persian fonts without the need for additional
    pre-processing steps such as feature extraction, binarization,
    normalization, etc.
